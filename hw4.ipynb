    "## Exercise 1: implementing `DummyClassifier`\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "rubric={autograde}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course (unlike CPSC 340) you will generally **not** be asked to implement machine learning algorihtms (like logistic regression) from scratch. However, this exercise is an exception: you will implement the simplest possible classifier, `DummyClassifier`.\n",
    " \n",
    "As a reminder, `DummyClassifier` is meant as a baseline and is generally a simple \"model\" you could \"fit\" to a dataset. All it does is predict the most popular class in the training set. So if there are more 0s than 1s it predicts 0 every time, and if there are more 1s than 0s it predicts 1 every time. For `predict_proba` it looks at the frequencies in the training set, so if you have 30% 0's and 70% 1's it predicts `[0.3 0.7]` every time. Thus, `fit` only looks at `y` (not `X`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will find starter code for a class called `MyDummyClassifier`, which has methods `fit()`, `predict()`, `predict_proba()` and `score()`. Your task is to fill in those four functions. To get you started, I have given you a `return` statement in each case that returns the correct data type: \n",
    "- `fit` returns nothing\n",
    "- `predict` returns an array whose size is the number of examples\n",
    "- `predict_proba` returns an array whose size is the number of examples x 2, and\n",
    "- `score` returns a float\n",
    "\n",
    "The next code block has some tests you can use to assess whether your code is working. \n",
    "\n",
    "I suggest starting with `fit` and `predict`, and making sure those are working before moving on to `predict_proba`. For `predict_proba`, you should return the frequency of each class in the training data. **Your `score` function should call your `predict` function**. Again, you can compare with `DummyClassifier` using the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sklearn`'s `DummyClassifier` works when you have more than two classes, and also works if the target values are encoded differently, for example as \"cat\", \"dog\", \"eagle\", etc. However, for the sake of simplifying this question, we will consider **binary classification** only. Furthermore, we will assume that these classes are encoded as 0 and 1. In other words, you can safely assume that the variable y contains only 0's and 1's"

In CPSC 340, we would go all the way down into `LogisticRegression` and understand how `fit` works, line by line. Here we're not going into that at all, but I still think this type of question (and Exercise 1) is a useful middle ground. I do want you to know what is going on in `Pipeline` and in `cross_validate` even if we don't cover the details of `fit`. To get into logistic regression's `fit` requires a bunch of math; here, we're keeping it more conceptual and avoiding all those prerequisites."

That lines up with what I saw in 3.1/3.2: max_features around 10k and C near 1.0. So the vocabulary size matches exactly, and the best C from random search is just a nearby point on the same plateau.\n",

In 3.1/3.2, I tuned each hyperparameter in isolation, which doesn't necessarily capture how it will interact when combined with other hyperparameters. On the other hand, grid/random search tunes them jointly, which can shift the arg-max slightly through mild interactions between the hyperparameters. Random search also samples continuously, so values it chooses is almost never a whole number value like 1.0(best C value from grid-search)."

That’s a tiny gap and well within the fold-to-fold variability I saw earlier, so I’d say it's because of sampling noise and the test split being a slightly different draw from the distribution.\n",
    "I don’t think this indicates “overfitting to the validation set.” I tuned with 5-fold CV (not a single hold-out), and the validation surface around the optimum was basically flat, so several nearby settings perform the same. A small drop like this is exactly what I’d expect from normal variance rather than genuine overfit to validation."

    "\n",
    "2. I’d pick predict_proba because the probabilities gives me context on how confident the model is when making each prediction (Ex. [0.9 0.1] is much stronger than [0.52 0.48]). Using probabilities, I can also choose a custom threshold, whereas hard labels throw that information away and always uses 0.5 as the decision threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. RandomizedSearchCV is far more sample-efficient especially in situations where we have many hyperparameters to be tuned. It's also less prone to optimization bias when tuning, becuase it often evaluates less values than gridSearchCV, making it less likely to find a \"lucky\" value that works well due to overfitting on the validation set."
